## üõ† **How It Works**
1. **Upload an Image**:
   - Take a photo of your ingredients using your smartphone or upload one from your device.

2. **Ingredient Recognition**:
   - **FoodSAM**, based on the **Segment Anything Model (SAM)**, segments the image into individual food items. FoodSAM‚Äôs fine-tuned capabilities ensure pixel-level precision, even for mixed or overlapping ingredients.
   - The **Vision-Language Model (e.g., GPT-4o)** complements FoodSAM by generating context-aware ingredient descriptions.

3. **Retrieve and Recommend**:
   - User preferences, combined with detected ingredients, guide the system to retrieve recipes.
   - **RAG mechanisms** enhance recipe accuracy and relevance by accessing an up-to-date recipe database.

4. **Personalization**:
   - The system refines recipes using **LLMs**, tailoring them to match your preferences.
